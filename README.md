# Registry by Tamarou

Registry is a web application to track and manage event participants, and to
provide a platform for event organizers to communicate with participants.

## Getting Started

### Hosted Version

Simply go to https://registry.tamarou.com and create an account for the hosted
version. This is by far the easiest way to get started.

### Self-Hosted Version

To host your own version of Registry, we highly recommend using the Docker
Image and hosting on a platform like Digital Ocean or Render.com.
