# Alex - Registry Solo Founder

## Core Identity

**Who They Are:**
A technical solo founder with 25+ years of experience building web applications, running Registry as a Tiny Empire - a lifestyle business optimized for freedom and profit, not growth and scale. Influenced by Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Work Week and Joshua Tiernan's Tiny Empires philosophy, aiming for 15-20 hours/week of work once systems are established.

**Current Stage:**
Pre-revenue with a committed first customer who will switch once specific features are built. They're in the classic bootstrap valley of uncertainty - multiple simultaneous blockers around product readiness, pricing validation, customer pipeline, and product-market fit confirmation.

## Business Goals & Philosophy

**Revenue Goals:**
- Target: $200K-$300K annual recurring revenue
- "Enough" threshold: $100K-$150K (comfortable lifestyle without complexity)
- Focus: Hourly rate optimization over absolute revenue maximization

**Time Goals:**
- Target: 15-20 hours/week (or less) once established
- Philosophy: Maximum automation and systems are essential, not optional
- Work that energizes vs. drains: Still discovering, open to optimization

**Market Philosophy:**
- Small niche (100-500 potential customers) that can be dominated
- "Be the biggest fish in a small pond"
- After-school programs are the focused niche
- Still validating exact market size

**Tiny Empire Principles:**
- Freedom over growth - build business around life, not life around business
- Profit optimization - maximize take-home through strategic design
- Time efficiency - think in terms of hourly rate, not just revenue
- Strategic simplicity - do less better rather than more mediocrely
- Sustainable practices - build for long-term enjoyment, not burnout

**Technical Expertise:**
- Deep expertise: 25+ years building Perl-based web applications
- Built Registry's initial version personally
- Comfortable with complex features and deep technical troubleshooting
- Current workflow: Leverages Claude Code while maintaining technical ownership
- Stack: Perl, PostgreSQL, HTMX, Mojolicious

**Operational Advantages:**
- Can build what's needed without dependencies on contractors/employees
- Built PriceOps infrastructure for production pricing experimentation
- Technical skill enables rapid iteration and low operational costs
- No technical debt from outsourcing or communication overhead

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build features efficiently using AI assistance
- Maintain control over technical decisions
- Optimize for maintainability and automation
- Reduce operational overhead through smart architecture

## Current Challenges & Blockers

**Pre-Revenue Blockers:**
1. **Product readiness** - critical features still in development for first customer
2. **Customer pipeline** - need more conversations beyond first committed customer
3. **Product-market fit validation** - confirming this solves a real "painkiller" problem
4. **Pricing optimization** - existing competitors provide pricing benchmarks, but need to validate specific model (subscription vs. transaction vs. hybrid) through PriceOps experimentation

**Resource Constraints:**
- Solo founder wearing all hats (product, sales, support, development, strategy)
- Limited time to balance feature development with business development
- Bootstrap cash flow constraints during pre-revenue phase
- Need to prove product-market fit before scaling operations

## Customer Acquisition Strategy

**Primary Channels (Still Validating):**
- **Referrals (highest priority)** - Starting with committed first customer, building word-of-mouth engine
- **Community presence** - Being where after-school program directors already congregate (Reddit, forums, industry groups)
- "Upside-down marketing" approach: be findable where people are already looking for solutions

**First Customer Advantage:**
- Committed customer with defined feature requirements
- Real-world validation from day one
- Natural source of testimonials and case studies
- Potential referral engine into similar organizations

**Sales Philosophy:**
- Direct conversations with decision-makers
- Focus on demonstrating clear value and ROI
- B2B approach (programs/organizations, not individual parents)
- Building trust through niche expertise and focus

**Acquisition Goals:**
- First 10-20 customers through referrals and community presence
- Minimal marketing spend during validation phase
- High-touch early customers to understand needs and build case studies

## Success Metrics & Optimization

**Primary Metrics:**
- Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue (MRR/ARR)
- Hourly rate: Revenue ÷ Hours Worked
- Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value
- Time spent on operational tasks vs. strategic work

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Customer retention and churn rates
- Feature adoption and engagement
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Platform uptime and reliability

**Optimization Focus:**
- Increase hourly rate through automation and efficiency
- Reduce time-to-value for customers (faster onboarding)
- Minimize operational overhead through systems
- Focus on high-leverage activities, eliminate low-value work

---

## Daily Activities & Work Allocation

**Current Reality (Pre-Revenue):**
- Product development and feature implementation for first customer
- System architecture and automation infrastructure
- Customer conversations and validation
- Strategic planning for pricing and positioning
- Still discovering what work energizes vs. drains

**Target State (15-20 hrs/week, Post-Product-Market-Fit):**
- **Strategic work** - Product decisions, pricing experiments, high-value customer conversations
- **Selective technical work** - Features that require deep expertise or are enjoyable to build
- **Everything else** - Eliminated, automated, or delegated (in that order)
- **Focus areas to determine** - Still learning which activities provide highest ROI and satisfaction

**Work Optimization Philosophy (Priority Order):**
1. **Eliminate** - Question if work needs to exist at all (80/20 rule ruthlessly applied)
2. **Automate** - Build systems to handle routine, repeatable work
3. **Delegate** - Only after elimination and automation are maximized

**Systems & Automation Priorities:**
- Customer onboarding and self-service
- Billing and payment processing (via Stripe + Minion)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Data backups and recovery
- Support ticket triage and common responses
- Workflow execution and notifications

## Key Insights for Product & Business Decisions

**Decision-Making Framework:**
- Does this increase hourly rate? (revenue up or time down)
- Does this move toward 15-20 hour work week?
- Can this be eliminated before automating or building?
- Does this help validate product-market fit?
- Does this serve the small niche dominance strategy?

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Building features that require constant manual intervention
- Targeting broad markets that require scale
- Taking on customers that need 24/7 support
- Building features that compete on network effects
- Adding complexity that increases operational burden

**Success Patterns to Pursue:**
- High-value customers in focused niche
- Self-service systems with minimal ongoing maintenance
- Automated workflows and notifications
- Clear pricing that customers understand and pay
- Referral-driven growth with minimal marketing spend
- Technical architecture that enables solo operation

## Persona Summary

Alex represents the Tiny Empire solo founder archetype: deeply technical, experience-rich, optimizing for freedom and lifestyle rather than growth and scale. They're in the critical pre-revenue phase with a committed first customer, working to validate product-market fit while building the systems and automation that will enable their target 15-20 hour work week.

Their advantage is technical depth that eliminates dependency on contractors and enables rapid iteration. Their challenge is the classic bootstrap uncertainty: multiple simultaneous blockers that need to be systematically addressed to reach first revenue and validation.

Success for Alex looks like: $100K-$150K+ ARR, 15-20 hours/week, dominated small niche, automated operations, and a business that supports their life rather than consuming it.
