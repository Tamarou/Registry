# Cameron

* Role: Aspiring business owner (artist seeking stable revenue)
* Background: Cameron is a ceramic artist who has been making a living through art sales, private pottery lessons, and occasional work at local studios and summer camps. While passionate about their art, they struggle with the inconsistent income from art sales and gallery shows. After seeing the success of established afterschool programs like Jordan's, Cameron is exploring the opportunity to create a structured afterschool ceramics program that could provide stable income while preserving time for their artistic practice.

* Goals:
    - To create a sustainable part-time income stream teaching ceramics across multiple schools (targeting 5 schools with ~20 kids each)
    - To maintain and grow their personal art practice with the financial stability of consistent school contracts
    - To share their passion for ceramics with children while building a reliable business model
    - To minimize administrative burden so they can focus on what they love: creating art and inspiring young artists

* Challenges:
    - Limited experience with business administration and financial management
    - Anxiety about the financial risk of transitioning from freelance art to structured business
    - Uncertainty about managing parent relationships and expectations
    - Need for a turnkey solution that handles logistics while they focus on curriculum and art
    - Balancing time between teaching commitments and personal artistic development

* Registry Needs:
    - Maximum ease of use with minimal learning curve
    - Automated administrative tasks (enrollment, payments, communications)
    - Simple multi-location management for teaching across multiple schools
    - Clear financial reporting to track business viability
    - Parent communication tools that require minimal manual intervention
