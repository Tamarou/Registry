# Registry Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the Registry system. This includes architectural decisions, personas, mission statements, and other important documents that help explain the system.

## Important Note

The contents of this directory are informational and possibly aspirational. They may not reflect the current implementation of the system at any given time. These documents serve as:

- Design intentions and goals
- Architectural decisions and patterns
- User personas and scenarios
- System capabilities and constraints
- Future development plans

While we strive to keep documentation up-to-date, the source code is the ultimate source of truth for current system behavior.

## Directory Structure

- `/architecture` - System architecture documents and design decisions
- `/deployment` - Instructions and configurations for deploying Registry
- `/personas` - User personas and scenarios that drive development
- `MISSION.md` - Core mission and vision statements
